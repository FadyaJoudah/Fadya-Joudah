### About Me

A seasoned full-stack developer based in Vancouver, my journey began with translation and interpretation, immersing myself in the nuances of various languages. From Arabic to English and now, various programming languages, my expertise has evolved. With a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development, I continuously broaden my skill set, spanning JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, React, and Node.js. 

In parallel, I've been actively exploring the dynamic field of data science. I've dived into statistics, exploratory data analysis, and the art of visualization. With a dedication to learning, I've been enhancing my skills in data manipulation, machine learning, and leveraging libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for analysis and visual representation.
